###Course Policies: 

####Policy on Attendance: 
Students are expected to attend class. Online ELC materials are designed to supplement, rather than replace, classroom presentations. Essential information about assignments, extensions of due dates, format of exam questions, etc. may be announced or discussed in class with no accompanying posting on ELC. 

####Policy on Collaboration: 
The purpose of course projects is to familiarize the student with concepts and details of C++ programming. 

These may be pair-programming projects or individual projects, as assigned. Individual projects should be worked on only by that individual. Pair projects should be worked on only by members of the pair. 

We recognize that student interaction can facilitate learning. Accordingly, students are both permitted and encouraged to ask certain types of questions of one another but should be aware that direct exchange of code is prohibited, as is line-by-line assistance. 

Exams are closed-book. No outside assistance is permitted. No additional materials may be used. 

###Late Policy: 
Late submissions of projects/assignments will be accepted with a penalty computed as follows: 

score = Max_Score * Percentage_Score * (0.90)^(days_late). 

A day is a 24 hour period, rounded up to the nearest day. 

For example:  
You turn your project in 3 days late, and received a 95% score based on the work done. Your recorded score will be:  
score = 100 * (0.95) * (0.90)^3  
score = 100 * (0.95) * (0.729)  
score = 69

###Grading Policy: 
Your grade in this course will be calculated as follows: 
* Exams: 45% (midterm = 20%, final = 25%) 
* Quizzes: 10% 
* Projects: 40% 
* Attendance: 5% 

Letter Grades assigned as follows:

Grade | Letter
----- | ------
93 <= Grade | A
89 <= Grade < 93 | A-
86 <= Grade < 89 | B+
83 <= Grade < 86 | B
79 <= Grade < 83 | B-
76 <= Grade < 79 | C+
73 <= Grade < 76 | C
69 <= Grade < 73 | C-
65 <= Grade < 69 | D
Grade < 65 | F

###Academic Honesty
All students are responsible for knowing the University's policy on academic honesty. All assignments/projects submitted in this course must be your own unless you have received my permission to collaborate and have properly acknowledged receiving assistance. It is the responsibility of the instructor and the TA to uphold the University's academic honesty policy and report my belief of dishonesty to the Office of the Vice President for Instruction.
