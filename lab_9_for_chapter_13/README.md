###Lab Objectives
This lab was designed to reinforce programming concepts from Chapter 13 of C++ How To Program, Seventh
Edition. In this lab, you will practice:

* Creating an Account base class that contains virtual functions and derived classes SavingsAccount and
CheckingAccount.
* Defining virtual functions.
* Calling virtual functions.
* Downcasting with a pointer with the dynamic_cast operator.

###Description of the Problem
Develop a polymorphic banking program using the Account hierarchy created in Exercise 12.10. Create a vector
of Account pointers to SavingsAccount and CheckingAccount objects. For each Account in the vector, allow
the user to specify an amount of money to withdraw from the Account using member function debit and an
amount of money to deposit into the Account using member function credit. As you process each Account,
determine its type. If an Account is a SavingsAccount, calculate the amount of interest owed to the Account
using member function calculateInterest, then add the interest to the account balance using member func-
tion credit. After processing an Account, print the updated account balance obtained by invoking base class
member function getBalance.


###Sample Output
```
Account 1 balance: $25.00
Enter an amount to withdraw from Account 1: 15.00
Enter an amount to deposit into Account 1: 10.50
Adding $0.61 interest to Account 1 (a SavingsAccount)
Updated Account 1 balance: $21.11
Account 2 balance: $80.00
Enter an amount to withdraw from Account 2: 90.00
Debit amount exceeded account balance.
Enter an amount to deposit into Account 2: 45.00
$1.00 transaction fee charged.
Updated Account 2 balance: $124.00
Account 3 balance: $200.00
Enter an amount to withdraw from Account 3: 75.50
Enter an amount to deposit into Account 3: 300.00
Adding $6.37 interest to Account 3 (a SavingsAccount)
Updated Account 3 balance: $430.87
Account 4 balance: $400.00
Enter an amount to withdraw from Account 4: 56.81
$0.50 transaction fee charged.
Enter an amount to deposit into Account 4: 37.83
$0.50 transaction fee charged.
Updated Account 4 balance: $380.02
```

###Problem-Solving Tips
1. To achieve polymorphism, declare the functions that should be called polymorphically as virtual. To
indicate a virtual function within a class definition, add “virtual” before the function prototype.
When the virtual functions are redefined in a derived class, those member function prototypes should
also be preceded by the keyword virtual as a good programming practice.
2. To determine if a pointer to an Account object is actually pointing to a SavingsAccount object, down-
cast it to a SavingsAccount * using the dynamic_cast operator. If the pointer returned by this opera-
tion is not the null pointer (i.e., 0) then the object is a SavingsAccount object and that pointer can be
used to access members unique to class SavingsAccount.
3. Remember that your compiler may require you to enable run-time type information (RTTI) for this
particular project before this program will run correctly.

###Debugging
The program (Fig. L 13.9–Fig. L 13.15) in this section does not run properly. Fix all the compilation errors so
that the program will compile successfully. Once the program compiles, compare the output with the sample
output, and eliminate any logic errors that may exist. The sample output demonstrates what the program’s out-
put should be once the program’s code has been corrected.

1. metric
2. standard
